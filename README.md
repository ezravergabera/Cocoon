> A Python-based programming language designed for young learners.

## How to use

1. Open your preferred command-line interface and change directory to the folder where the cloned repo would be downloaded to by entering `cd <path-to-the-folder>` to your terminal

2. Clone the repo to the folder by entering `git clone https://github.com/ezravergabera/Cocoon` in your command-line interface

3. Change directory by inputting `cd Cocoon` to the terminal

4. Install the required modules by entering `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Follow the next instructions in using the lexical analyzer

There are two ways on how to use the lexical analyzer:

1. By running the [GUI](/gui.py)

2. By running the [shell](/shell.py) in your command line, passing two options which is `-c` or `-f`.
        
## Shell Parameters

All parameters are case-insensitive. Only one option can be used at a time.

## -cli | -c

The `-cli` | `-c` is passed to use the cli version of the lexical analyzer.

Example: ```python shell.py -c```

## -file  | -f

The `-file` or `-f` is followed by the file name of the existing KKUN file as it's second passed argument. The file must have an extension of .kkun in order for it to be recognized

Example: ```python shell.py -f <filename>```
